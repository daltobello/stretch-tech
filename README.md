## Abstract
The Met Gallery is an immersive virtual museum experience, granting users access to a curated selection of the Metropolitan Museum of Art's European Paintings collection. Dive into a world of timeless masterpieces. This project's primary objective was to create a React application with global state management via Redux Toolkit. Users can click on a painting to delve into its details, save their favorites, and conveniently review their cherished artworks. The application provides smooth navigation, supporting users with browser history controls, and ensures a consistent experience through comprehensive error handling for both server-side and user-related issues.
